DESCRIPTION: This script is for finding the calibration matrices of a camera.
             It simply prints the matrices to the screen as well as the size of the image.
             In order to properly calibrate the camera, you need to load at least
             ten images of the board from different angles.  Once you run this script
             once, you can simply save the matrices for use in other code.
